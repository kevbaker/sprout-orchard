Apple Orchard: Scripts (bash & ruby) to support imaging of OSX machines

# Why?
We image OSX machines to use in conjunction with
[DeployStudio](http://www.deploystudio.com) in order to rapidly deploy developer
workstations.

# To whom do we complain?
_apple_orchard_ started as a side project of [Matthew
Kocher](https://github.com/mkocher) and [Brian
Cunnie](https://github.com/briancunnie) of Pivotal Labs in Summer 2011.
